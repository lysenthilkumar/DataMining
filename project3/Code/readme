K-Nearest Neighbor :


The program execution is done by running knn.py using Python3

> python3 knn.py

The program will ask for the following input paramters to be supplied:

Enter the name of the input file :  (text file to be given as input)
Enter the value of K : (integer value of K)

The performance measures Accuracy , Precision , Recall , F-Measure at the end of 10 folds are printed.



Naive Bayesian : 


The program execution is done by running knn.py using Python3

> python3 naive_bayes.py

The program will ask for the following input paramter to be supplied:

Enter the name of the input file : (text file to be given as input)


The performance measures Accuracy , Precision , Recall , F-Measure at the end of 10 folds are printed.



Decision tree programs execution : 


Code for just decision tree is within the file "decisionTree.py"
It requires no parameter and executes for the command as follows
>python3 decisionTree.py

Code for random forests is within the file "randomForests.py"
It requires no parameter and executes for the command as follows
>python3 randomForests.py

Code for adaptive boosting is within the file "adaBoosting.py"
It requires no parameter and executes for the command as follows
>python3 adaBoosting.py
