â€¢	The program execution is done by running the pcaProgram.py using Python 3

>python3 pcaProgram.py

This command will generate three graphs for the any data set each of them showing points obtained from the implementation of PCA algorithm, SVD algorithm and t-SNE algorithm.

While running for different dataset files, the respective lines at the end of the python file can be uncommented. This will call the function executing the entire program and pass the filename as an argument.
